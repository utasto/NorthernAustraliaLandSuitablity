# NorthernAustraliaLandSuitablity
Workflows and scripts for the Northern Australia land suitability assessment projects.
The directories atthe top level of the repo contains the R scripts used for a generic workflow for doing the DSM modelling and Land Suitability assessment processing for the CSIRO Northen Australia Water Resource Assessment Projects. Thus far, these projects include the NAWRA (Mitchell, Darwin and Fitzroy catchments) https://www.csiro.au/en/research/natural-environment/water/water-resource-assessment/nawra and the Roper River Catchment https://www.csiro.au/en/research/natural-environment/water/water-resource-assessment/roper-river-water-resource-assessment.

The generic workflow is based on the scripts used for the Roper Catchment work

The actual scripts used in the individual catchmnets work are also archived in this repo.
